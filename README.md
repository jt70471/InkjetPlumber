# Inkjet Plumber                                                        
## Overview
Inkjet Plumber is an application for the Mac that allows you to send a small print job to
one or more of your printers at an interval of your choosing. It was written with infrequent
inkjet users in mind, allowing you to automatically send a small print job to an otherwise idle
inkjet printer.

I make no claims that Inkjet Plumber will prevent clogs or reduce your ink costs, however,
it's generally accepted by many people that it's best to exercise your inkjet printer rather
than leave idle (or powered off) for long periods of time.

Many Windows users use [QImage Ultimate](http://www.ddisoftware.com/qimage-u/index.html) for this purpose,
however, [QImage Ultimate](http://www.ddisoftware.com/qimage-u/index.html) only runs on Windows and
I was not able to find a comparable application for the Mac.

*Update:* [Qimage One](https://binartem.com/(https://www.binartem.com/qimageone/) is now available for
Windows and macOS. Qimage One
provides the capability to send a scheduled purge sheet to your printers which replaces the
functionality provided by InkjetPlumber. I highly recommend InkjetPlumber users switch to Qimage One,
it's a great program for printing!

## Development

Inkjet Plumber is written in C++ using the [Qt Framework](https://www.qt.io/) and built
for the Mac OSX operating system. While the Qt Framework is very portable, I do not have access
to any Windows systems, so I can only provide an executable build for the Mac operating system
at this time.

## Downloads

You may download binary releases (dmg file) of Inkjet Plumber from
